# RePlAce
RePlAce: Advancing Solution Quality and Routability Validation in Global Placement

## Features
- Analytic and nonlinear placement algorithm. Solves electrostatic force equations using Nesterov's method. ([link](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jlu/papers/eplace-todaes14/paper.pdf))
- Verified with various commercial technologies using OpenDB (7/14/16/28/45/55/65nm).
- Verified deterministic solution generation with various compilers and OS. 
  * Compiler: gcc4.8-9.1/clang-7-9/apple-clang-11
  * OS: Ubuntu 16.04-18.04 / CentOS 6-8 / OSX 
- Cleanly rewritten as C++11.
- Supports Mixed-size placement mode.
- Supports fast image drawing modes with CImg library.

## How to Download and Build?
- If you want to use this as part of the OpenROAD project you should build it and use it from inside the integrated [OpenROAD app](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD). The standalone version is available as a legacy code in [standalone branch](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/RePlAce/tree/standalone).
- For OpenROAD-flow users, manuals for released binaries are available in readthedocs. [(Getting-Started)](https://openroad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/getting-started.html)
- For developers, manuals for building a binary is available in OpenROAD app repo. [(OpenROAD app)](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD) 
- Note that RePlAce is a submodule of OpenROAD repo, and take a place as the **"global_placement"** command. 


## OpenROAD Tcl Usage (global_placement)

```
global_placement
    [-skip_initial_place]
    [-incremental]
    [-bin_grid_count grid_count]
    [-density density]
    [-init_density_penalty init_density_penalty]
    [-init_wirelength_coef init_wirelength_coef]
    [-min_phi_coef min_phi_coef]
    [-max_phi_coef max_phi_coef]
    [-overflow overflow]
    [-initial_place_max_iter max_iter]
    [-initial_place_max_fanout max_fanout]
    [-verbose_level verbose_level]
```

### Flow Control
* __skip_initial_place__ : Skip the initial placement (BiCGSTAB solving) before Nesterov placement. IP improves HPWL by ~5% on large designs. Equal to '-initial_place_max_iter 0'
* __incremental__ : Enable the incremental global placement. Users would need to tune other parameters (e.g. init_density_penalty) with pre-placed solutions. 

### Tuning Parameters
* __bin_grid_count__ : Set bin grid's counts. Default: Defined by internal algorithm. [64,128,256,512,..., int]
* __density__ : Set target density. Default: 0.70 [0-1, float]
* __init_density_penalty__ : Set initial density penalty. Default: 8e-5 [1e-6 - 1e6, float]
* __init_wire_length__coef__ : Set initial wirelength coefficient. Default: 0.25 [unlimited, float] 
* __min_phi_coef__ : Set pcof_min(µ_k Lower Bound). Default: 0.95 [0.95-1.05, float]
* __max_phi_coef__ : Set pcof_max(µ_k Upper Bound). Default: 1.05 [1.00-1.20, float]
* __overflow__ : Set target overflow for termination condition. Default: 0.1 [0-1, float]
* __initial_place_max_iter__ : Set maximum iterations in initial place. Default: 20 [0-, int]
* __initial_place_max_fanout__ : Set net escape condition in initial place when 'fanout >= initial_place_max_fanout'. Default: 200 [1-, int]

### Other Options
* __verbose_level__ : Set verbose level for RePlAce. Default: 1 [0-10, int]

Note that all of the TCL commands are defined in the [replace.tcl](../src/replace.tcl) and [replace.i](../src/replace.i).
